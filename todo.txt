Capture & reproducibility
- [x] Add run manifest per execution: resolved config, recipe source/path, overrides, schema id, git SHA + dirty flag, Python version, uv lock hash.
- [x] Create run IDs and manifest directories; petname-based IDs by default, `--run-id`/`STRYX_RUN_ID` override, `create-run-id` helper command.
- [ ] Propagate resolved config to `runs/<id>/resolved.yaml` (configurable runs dir) and expose path via `STRYX_CONFIG`.
- [ ] Rank-aware artifact policy: rank 0 writes manifest/snapshot by default; optional env (e.g., STRYX_ARTIFACTS_ALL_RANKS=1) for per-rank outputs under `runs/<id>/ranks/<rank>/`.
- [ ] Code snapshot support: default to streamed git patch (binary-safe); optional `--snapshot` to mirror tracked files into `runs/<id>/code/` when clean.
- [ ] Env capture: record seed info, key env vars (CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES, RANK/LOCAL_RANK/WORLD_SIZE, SLURM*), and `uv export --no-dev` into `runs/<id>/environment.txt`.
- [ ] Provenance improvements: allow `new --from-run <id>` to embed originating run ID into `__stryx__` lineage.

Distributed support
- [ ] Distributed autodetection: detect torchrun/accelerate/SLURM via envs (LOCAL_RANK/RANK/WORLD_SIZE, ACCELERATE_*, SLURM_*); guard relaunch loops with STRYX_LAUNCHED.
- [ ] Shared config for distributed runs: first process writes resolved config + run ID; workers reuse it (no per-rank rebuild); skip relaunch if envs indicate we’re already inside a launcher.
- [ ] Diagnostics: on rank 0, print concise summary (run ID, world size, backend if available, config path); keep workers quiet unless error.

CLI/UX
- [ ] Minimal CLI additions: `run` flags for `--run-dir` and `--snapshot`; `show --run <id>` to display a manifest; `list` to show recent runs with recipe linkage.
