# Stryx

**Typed configuration compiler for ML experiments.**

Stryx sits between Sacred and Hydra: lightweight and composable like Sacred, without Hydra’s indirection.

## Key Features
*   **Type-Safe**: Pydantic configs with IDE support.
*   **Reproducible**: Strict `run` command prevents "forgotten flag" syndrome.
*   **Interactive**: Built-in TUI for editing configs.
*   **Tracked**: Automatic capture of logs, status, and results.
